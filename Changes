Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-Database

0.09_1  2010-10-25
        - Add some proper tests [Franck Cuny]

0.09    2010-09-28
        - Allow definition of multiple connections, and accept a param to the
          database() keyword to specify which connection you need a handle for.
          This was released as 0.08_01 for testing.

0.08    2010-09-14
        - Bugfix - make SQLite DWIMmery from previous version actually work.

0.07    2010-09-06
        - Extra params in DSN (database, host, port) should be separated with
          semi-colons, not colons.  Thanks to Steve Atkins for reporting this.
        - Documentation update to reflect use of $dbh->ping
        - If connecting to SQLite, which requires 'dbname' rather than
          'database', provide 'dbname' instead, so it will Just Work

0.06    2010-06-15
        - Stupid typo fix in documentation for features added in 0.05.  I wish
          I'd spotted this mistake before releasing 0.05, rather than just
          after!

0.05    2010-06-15
        - Allow parameters to be passed to DBI->connect call (e.g. RaiseError),
          and support providing a set of statements to execute upon connection.
          Thanks to Igor Bujna for providing this feature!

0.04    2010-05-20
        - If DBD driver does not implement ping(), perform our own connection
          check by performing a simple query.  This will check that the DB
          connection is still alive, and avoid needless re-connects, which are
          expensive.  Also seems to fix a problem Tadzik saw with a warning from
          DBD::SQLite when the old handle was thrown away.

0.03    2010-05-17
        - Fix warning where $last_connection_check was initially undefined but
          used in numeric comparison.  Thanks to Tadzik for reporting.

0.02    2010-04-18
        Documentation fixes, thanks to "mrpants" on Github:
        - Plugin names in config.yml are case-sensitive for current CPAN
          releases of Dancer; my commit fdc3f3 makes it case-insenitive, but
          that hasn't hit CPAN yet, so people using CPAN releases could be
          confused
        - stray trailing single-quote in example config

0.01    2010-04-14
        Initial version developed.
