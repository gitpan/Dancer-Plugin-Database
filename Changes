Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-Database

0.02    2010-04-18
        Documentation fixes, thanks to "mrpants" on Github:
        - Plugin names in config.yml are case-sensitive for current CPAN
          releases of Dancer; my commit fdc3f3 makes it case-insenitive, but
          that hasn't hit CPAN yet, so people using CPAN releases could be
          confused
        - stray trailing single-quote in example config

0.01    2010-04-14
        Initial version developed.
