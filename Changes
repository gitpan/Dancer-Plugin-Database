        - Allow parameters to be passed to DBI->connect call (e.g. RaiseError),
          and support providing a set of statements to execute upon connection.
          Thanks to Igor Bujna for providing this feature!

        - If DBD driver does not implement ping(), perform our own connection
          check by performing a simple query.  This will check that the DB
          connection is still alive, and avoid needless re-connects, which are
          expensive.  Also seems to fix a problem Tadzik saw with a warning from
          DBD::SQLite when the old handle was thrown away.

        - Fix warning where $last_connection_check was initially undefined but
          used in numeric comparison.  Thanks to Tadzik for reporting.

        Documentation fixes, thanks to "mrpants" on Github:
        - Plugin names in config.yml are case-sensitive for current CPAN
          releases of Dancer; my commit fdc3f3 makes it case-insenitive, but
          that hasn't hit CPAN yet, so people using CPAN releases could be
          confused
        - stray trailing single-quote in example config

0.01    2010-04-14
        Initial version developed.
